# Ascending to The Presidency: Comparing Presidential Inaugural Speeches through Text Mining
###This project is inspired by the debating about whether Trump is the second coming of Regan.###

One of the acts that all presidents perform is the inaugural speech, the speech given by a newly sworn-in president that “set a tone for the administration” and “gives the president a first ‘center stage’ opportunity to introduce his vision to the nation and the world” (The White House Historical Association). As a speech that appeals more to the emotions and sentiments of the country, can the text of this speech – and potentially other words from the president – be measured the same way as the GDP, for example? With text mining and sentiment analysis, it could well be possible to give a number to such speeches depending on context. As IBM states, text mining “...is the process of analyzing collections of textual materials in order to capture key concepts and themes and uncover hidden relationships and trends without requiring that you know the precise words or terms that authors have used to express those concepts” (IBM). By using such tools and methods to analyze inaugural speeches, this project attempts to compare the current President to past Presidents, analyze any correlation with such sentiment to other objective measures, and answer the question Glasser asks – “Is Trump the Second Coming of Reagan?” (Glasser).
